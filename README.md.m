# Rocket Lander Challenge

**Rocket Lander Challenge** is a fun and educational 2D game built with Python and Pygame. In this game, players control a rocket with two independent engines in a low-gravity environment. The goal is to safely land the rocket on a designated landing pad on a bumpy asteroid surface. Press both engine keys for full thrust, or press one to tilt the rocket and adjust your trajectory. Land too hard or miss the landing pad, and it's game over!

## Features

- **Dual Engine Control:**  
  Each engine is controlled by a separate key. Use both for full thrust, or one for a tilt maneuver.

- **Physics-Based Gameplay:**  
  Experience low-gravity physics where momentum and precise control are key to a safe landing.

- **Challenging Terrain:**  
  Navigate a bumpy asteroid surface with a single smooth landing pad as your target.

- **Crash & Restart:**  
  Land too hard or off the pad, and the rocket explodesâ€”challenge yourself to improve with each attempt!

## Gameplay

In Rocket Lander Challenge, you must guide your rocket to a safe landing on the landing pad. The game simulates realistic low-gravity physics, requiring careful control and timing of your engine thrusts. Experiment with using single-engine thrust to adjust your rocket's tilt and trajectory.
